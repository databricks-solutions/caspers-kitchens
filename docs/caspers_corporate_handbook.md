## Company Overview

### What is a Ghost Kitchen?

Casper's Kitchen operates as a "ghost kitchen" (also known as a virtual kitchen, cloud kitchen, or dark kitchen). Unlike traditional restaurants, we have no dine-in area or customer-facing storefront. Our facilities are optimized purely for food preparation and delivery fulfillment.

This model allows us to:

- Operate multiple virtual brands from a single location
- Focus entirely on food quality and delivery speed
- Reduce overhead costs associated with front-of-house operations
- Quickly adapt to changing customer preferences

### Virtual Brands

Each Casper's Kitchen location hosts multiple virtual restaurant brands. These brands appear as separate restaurants on delivery platforms but are all prepared in our kitchens. Brand availability varies by location and may change based on market demand.

Our portfolio includes 24 distinct virtual brands across categories including:

- **Asian Cuisine**: Wok This Way, Pho Real, Thai One On
- **Mexican**: Taco 'Bout It, Burrito Bandits
- **American Comfort**: Five Gals Burgers, Cluck Yeah, Wing Commander
- **Health-Focused**: Grain & Glory, NootroNourish, Green Machine
- **Italian**: Pasta La Vista, Pizza My Heart
- **Specialty**: Seoul Food, Curry Up, Mediterranean Nights

### Our Business Model

Ghost kitchens represent the future of food service. By eliminating dine-in overhead, we can:

1. **Optimize for Delivery**: Every aspect of our kitchen is designed for speed and consistency in delivery orders
2. **Multi-Brand Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure supports multiple brands simultaneously
3. **Data-Driven Operations**: Real-time analytics drive menu, staffing, and operational decisions
4. **Rapid Market Testing**: New brands and menu items can be launched and tested quickly
